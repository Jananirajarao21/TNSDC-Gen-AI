      The approach of identifying and translating text characters in textual or photographic files in order to convert them into digital data is referred to as character recognition. It is often used in OCR (Optical Character Recognition) systems and is suitable for various forms of text. Data sorting and analysis are vital in domains such as healthcare, banking, and education.Preprocessing visuals, retrieving features, and sorting various word forms are all part of character recognition. Convolutional neural networks along with other machine learning methods are utilized for better accuracy in this process.Character recognition has gone through a revolution due to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), that are capable of recognizing and extract beneficial details from input data. They preserve intricate patterns and spatial connections in images that include text or handwritten characters. CNNs are robust for applications like recognizing optical characters and document automation since they can cope with distinctions in writing styles, the fonts, and orientations.

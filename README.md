It is often used in OCR (Optical Character Recognition) systems and is suitable for various forms of text. Data sorting and analysis are vital in domains such as healthcare, banking, and education.Preprocessing visuals, retrieving features, and sorting various word forms are all part of character recognition. Convolutional neural networks along with other machine learning methods are utilized for better accuracy in this process.
